# Ardashboard - Bank Transactions Reader
I wanted to try out F# and I needed a way to consult my last bank transactions (my Bank sucks).

So, for that reason I used my Gmail account to retrieve notification emails from my bank, parsed and stored in a KOOOL console app. ðŸš€

You could use it if:
- You get OAuth secrets for your Gmail account
- You own a Webank bank account in Italy, with transactions notifications on via emails
